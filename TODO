Swift Mailer:
-------------

 * Think about the interface for a HeaderFactory
   - Needs to have a createHeaderFromString() method
   - Needs to have a createAttributeFromString() method
 * See if some of the Headers can be refactored/removed
 * Content-type header, Content-disposition etc... what type?
 * MimeEntity class
 * Acceptance tests for:
   - Some Headers (which use Encoders)
   - Attributes
 * CharacterReaderFactory (map charsets to CharacterReaders).
 * Splitting logic in MailboxHeader (?<!\\\\), is wrong!!!
   - Comma can be in quoted-string.

Test Suite:
-----------

 * Change test results bar to show actual number of tests running
 * Add a thin bar showing the percentage progress below the results bar
 * Handle fatal errors? Maybe handle at the backend?
 * Set cookies to remember what was collapsed/expanded
 * Hide package if search term removes all its test cases
