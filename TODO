Test Suite:
-----------

 * Change test results bar to show actual number of tests running
 * Add a thin bar showing the percentage progress below the results bar
 * Hide package if search term removes all its test cases
 * Some easy way to disable the JS
 * Smoke Test abilities.  Pretty much just needs to be able to display images.
