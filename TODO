Swift Mailer:
-------------

 * See if some of the Headers can be refactored/removed
 * Add a fixLE() method to MimePart (for ByteStreams too)
   - Perhaps make QpContentEncoder extend PlainContentEncoder so line wraps
     are handled correctly, and also add such canonicalization logic there.
     <?php $string = parent::encodeString($string);
     return $this->encodeString($string); ?>
 * MimeEntity classes
   - Image?
   - Message/Digest type
 * Message class
   - SimpleMessage
   - Message/Partial???
   - Message/external???
 * Make QpContentEncoder implement FieldChangeObserver so it can take on
   new charsets
 * Acceptance tests
   - Some Headers (which use Encoders)
 * CharacterReaderFactory (map charsets to CharacterReaders).
   - Big5
   - Shift-JIS
   - ISO-10646
   - CP950

Test Suite:
-----------

 * Change test results bar to show actual number of tests running
 * Add a thin bar showing the percentage progress below the results bar
 * Hide package if search term removes all its test cases
 * Some easy way to disable the JS
 * Smoke Test abilities.  Pretty much just needs to be able to display images.
