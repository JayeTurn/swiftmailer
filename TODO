Swift Mailer SE TODO:
---------------------

 * Read-receipts (Something in $message like CustomHeaderFactory?)
 * setPriority()
 * setMimeWarning() ?
 * Think about the interface for loading plugins
 * Failed recipients?
   - Mail
 * Event dispatching
   - Mail
 * Simplify the event system:
   - Get rid of the ability to bind to a source
 * CharacterReaders
   - Big5
   - Shift-JIS
   - ISO-10646
   - CP950
 * Transports
   - PopBeforeSmtp authentication
 * Swift_ByteStream_FileByteStream is too long
   - Swift_File ?
 * Plugins
   - FileEmbedder (Mime API issues? Streams?)
   - VERP

Missing unit tests:
-------------------

 * Writing to byte streams
 * Effective use of caching
 * Message body becoming mime part if attachment added
   - Make sure content-type header has no charset etc
 
Poorly implemented:
-------------------

 * PolymorphicBuffer == shite; should be two classes
 * writeTransformations() in buffer could fail
 * canonicalization logic could fail

Website Re-Design:
------------------

 * New Logo
 * New layout without sidebar
