Swift Mailer SE TODO:
---------------------

 * setMimeWarning()
 * Think about the interface for loading plugins
 * Re-implement caching
 * Re-think how to avoid CRLF . CRLF* (Filters?) - Done, needs implementing
 * Re-think how to convert CRLF to LF & Vice Versa*
 * Re-name PolymorphicBuffer to StreamBuffer
 * Failed recipients?
   - Mail
 * Event dispatching
   - Mail
 * Simplify the event system:
   - Get rid of the ability to bind to a source
 * CharacterReaders
   - Big5
   - Shift-JIS
   - ISO-10646
   - CP950
 * Transports
   - PopBeforeSmtp authentication
 * Add a Swift_Image::fromPath() method?
 * Plugins
   - FileEmbedder (Mime API issues? Streams?)
   - VERP
 * V3 Wrapper classes
 
Missing unit tests:
-------------------

 * Effective use of caching
 * Message body becoming mime part if attachment added
   - Make sure content-type header has no charset etc
 
Poorly implemented:
-------------------

 * writeTransformations() in buffer could fail*
 * canonicalization logic could fail
