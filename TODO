Swift Mailer SE TODO:
---------------------

 * Think about the interface for loading plugins ($transport->getEventDispatcher())
 * Re-think how to avoid CRLF . CRLF* (Filters?) - Done, needs implementing
 * Failed recipients in MailTransport
 * Event dispatching in MailTransport
 * Add test coverage for cache write through
 * Add a Swift_Image::fromPath() method?
 * FileEmbedder (Mime API issues? Streams?)
 * Test with qMail
 
Poorly implemented:
-------------------

 * Canonicalization logic in QpEncoder could lead to sporadic double line breaks
 
After first beta:
-----------------

* Simplify the event system:
   - Get rid of the ability to bind to a specific source
   - Benchmark difference creating "New" events instead of current convoluted setup
 * CharacterReaders
   - Big5
   - Shift-JIS
   - ISO-10646
   - CP950
 * VerpPlugin
 * PopBeforeSmtpPlugin
 * V3 Wrapper classes
