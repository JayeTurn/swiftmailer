Swift Mailer:
-------------

 * Think about the interface for a HeaderFactory
   - Needs to have a createHeaderFromString() method
   - Needs to have a createAttributeFromString() method
 * See if some of the Headers can be refactored/removed
 * Content-type header, Content-disposition etc... what type?
 * MimeDocument class
 * Rfc2231Encoder
 * Acceptance tests for:
   - Some Headers (which use Encoders)
   - Attributes
 * CharacterReaderFactory (map charsets to CharacterReaders).

Test Suite:
-----------

 * Change test results bar to show actual number of tests running
 * Add a thin bar showing the percentage progress below the results bar
 * Handle fatal errors? Maybe handle at the backend?
 * Collapse/expand subpackages as groups and run groups at a time
