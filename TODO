Swift Mailer SE TODO:
---------------------

 * Write some sanity tests
 * Read-receipts (Something in $message like CustomHeaderFactory?)
 * Think about the interface for loading plugins
 * Failed recipients?
   - Mail
   - Sendmail
   - SendEvent
 * Event dispatching
   - Sendmail
   - Mail
 * CharacterReaders
   - Big5
   - Shift-JIS
   - ISO-10646
   - CP950
 * Transports
   - PopBeforeSmtp authentication
   - Esmtp extension support
     - 8BITMIME
 * Plugins
   - FileEmbedder (Mime API issues? Streams?)
   - VERP
 * V3 Wrapper classes
 
Weaknesses:
-----------

 * writeTransformations() in buffer could fail
 * canonicalization logic could fail
 * streams aren't used in the decorator plugin
 * DI is a bit unclear what goes where
  
Refactors:
----------

 * Change setBodyAsString() and getBodyAsString() to just setBody() and getBody()
 * Split Esmtp into two classes and change what Sendmail extends
 * Consider namespacing dependency maps and storing them all centrally
   - e.g. "transport.smtp", "mime.message" and "events.dispatcher"
   - This way one factory can create classes which belong to another

Website Re-Design:
------------------

 * New Logo
 * New layout without sidebar
   - See getvanilla.com for inspiration
   - Thinking perhaps a red/white/grey color scheme
   - Adsense ads at the end of some pages
   - Documentation integrated
     - User comments filtered
     - V4/V3 separation (/docs/v3/something vs. /docs/v4/something)
     - Duplicate content from DokuWiki and add redirects
     - Show EE specific documentation to logged in users
   - Scrap the www. domain and do a redirect
   - Bug tracking
     - Integrated
     - Priority fixes for EE users
   - Take PayPal express checkout payments & paypal credit card payments
   - Issue licenses with usernames/passwords to download area
     - Allow purchase of additional licenses
     - Allow notification of new releases
   - Book (PDF) download

Swift Mailer Book:
------------------

 * 30-40 pages with examples
   - Include developer guide
