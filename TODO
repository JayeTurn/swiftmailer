Swift Mailer SE:
----------------

 * Consider namespacing dependency maps and storing them all centrally
   - e.g. "transport.smtp", "mime.message" and "events.dispatcher"
   - This way one factory can create classes which belong to another
 * Make the Log a plugin
 * Write some sanity tests
 * Read-receipts
 * CharacterReaders
   - Big5
   - Shift-JIS
   - ISO-10646
   - CP950
 * Transports
   - PopBeforeSmtp authentication
   - Esmtp extension support
     - 8BITMIME
 * Add a TransportExceptionEvent and TransportExceptionListener
   - Make logger throw a new TransportException with the log appended.
 * Plugins
   - Logger
   - Throttler
   - FileEmbedder (Mime API issues? Streams?)
