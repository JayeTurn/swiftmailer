Swift Mailer:
-------------

 * Think about the interface for a HeaderFactory
 * See if some of the Headers can be refactored/removed
 * HeaderAttributes
 * Maybe use ArrayAccess on the HeaderSet and HeaderAttributeSet?
 * Content-type header, Content-disposition etc... what type?
 * MimeDocument class

Test Suite:
-----------

 * Change test results bar to show actual number of tests running
 * Add a thin bar showing the percentage progress below the results bar
 * Handle fatal errors? Maybe handle at the backend?
